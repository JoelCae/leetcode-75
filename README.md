# LeetCode 75 study plan

Welcome to my LeetCode 75 journey! In this post, I'll be sharing my solutions and insights for 75 essential problems that are part of [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) study plan. 

The objective of this project is to improve my coding skills (analisys and solving problems). Then some solutions may not be the most efficient in terms of time or space complexity, however I try to find the best approach based on my current understanding. In the future, as I continue to learn and develop new skills, I hooe to improve the project with better algorithms and efficiency solutions.

You can visit the [github page](https://joelcae.github.io/leetcode-75/) and the [repository](https://github.com/JoelCae/leetcode-75) of this project. 

Note: The project is not finished yet. I am going to add the problems according I code it. 

All solutions are programmed in R, and I use Rmarkdown to manage the MD files to present the problems in a comprehensive way.

If you have any questions or suggestions, Iâ€™d be grateful to receive your message.
